# class

<b>Version:</b> v0.0.1

A file utility program to associate extra information with files,
including a name, description, tags, and key/value data.



## Notice

This program is currently untested and is thus prone to bugs, and may be unstable. Use it with caution.



## Build Instructions

- Install Go v1.15.8 (dev tested)
- `go build -o class main.go`
- that's it, folks



## Future Plans

A Go API will probably be built around this project, allowing you to view and change stored data from Golang.

All metadata will be queryable, which will allow efficient searching based on tags and other data.

This entire project will probably undergo a name change in the near future.
If you have any ideas, let me know.
